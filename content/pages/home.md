# Our Mission

VapeRecycling is passionate about properly reusing and recycling the resources inside of disposable vape devices. Many of these devices contain resources such as cobalt, nickel, magnesium, and lithium. The extraction, production, and improper disposal of these materials can devastate nearby ecosystems. Currently, child labor commonly used for the processing of these materials ([Sources]()). 

Our mission is to make it as easy as possible for the public to properly dispose of empty vapes by using technology to automate the recycling processes and get important materials back into the supply chain as quickly as possible. 

# How it Works

1. **Collect at least 5 used battery operated devices**
2. **Request a shipping label by submitting a photo of the devices**
3. **Once approved, a shipping label will arrive in your email**
4. **Package the devices securely and apply your shipping label ([How to Package and Ship Vapes]())**
5. **Drop the package in a mailbox near you, and forget about it!**
